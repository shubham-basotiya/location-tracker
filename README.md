I made this project for remembering routes on map you travelled.
let suppose, you settle in new city for your new job. now you want to go market for vegitables and other kichten products.
you searched on map(google and other maps) you see shop name and go there.
if you again wants to go there then again you have to searched on map that place/shop name in map but in this application you can save routes on map for a particular adddress from you want(give route name).
for using this application you have to first give router name in input box then it start from your current location to end location where you stop route then it saved in saved routes page.
Now, it show your saved route into list and you can see your route into map.

currently this application doesn't have user account facility but in future added. then a particular user can saved and seen own saved routes on map.
